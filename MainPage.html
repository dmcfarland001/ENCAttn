                                Have you ever thought, and we mean really thought about your use of attention? How about
                                the
                                lack of control you have over it? Scary stuff, we know. This web page is dedicated to
                                bringing
                                awareness on how our attention has been affected by the advent of new technologies. The
                                smart
                                phone, laptop, applications and notifications have all provided us with a slew of
                                distractions
                                from our day-to-day lives.

                                According to scholar Howard Rheingold, "you don't have to work to make your mind wander"
                                (PAGE).
                                This fact is present through the constant use of our devices. We tend to reach for our
                                technologies at the sight of any potential engagement. A ring, buzz, blink and vibration
                                all
                                set
                                us off course and into the realm of being digitally distracted. Though this isn't always
                                entirely bad, consider this: according to an article in the Harvard Business Review
                                entitled
                                Conquering Digital Distraction, a recent study found that distracted workers cost the
                                economy an
                                average of $995 billion a year (Conquering Digital Distraction 111). This high rate of
                                distraction can be attributed to what Rheingold calls "attentional blink". That is, the
                                temporary disruption caused when attention shifts from one thing to another. With 11
                                million
                                bits of information interacting with us every second and only 40 of those being
                                processed
                                consciously, it can get hard to prioritize focus over distraction (PAGE RHEINGOLD).
                                Research
                                suggests that this information overload is the cause for much of our what leads us to be
                                distracted.

                                In another study, German researchers who studied device-using students, found that
                                device-using
                                students researchers found that "attention is a mental mechanism that can be focused on
                                stimuli
                                in order to process them, but only a limited quantity of stimuli can be processed at any
                                given
                                time. If demands exceed available attentional capacity, the cognitive system overloads
                                and
                                performance suffers" (Aagaard PAGE). In other words, we can be overwhelmed and
                                compromised
                                by
                                the amount of stimuli we encounter.

                                it?

            First and foremost, there was a degree of meta thinking that went into creating this page. Particularly
            because the topic had to deal with attention and distraction. What was ironic at least for a few of us, was
            the fact that even though we were researching and were aware of the problem of attention/distraction, we
            could not quickly change our digital habits. Knowing full well of all of the possible consequences, we
            continued our daily routine of checking our phone, playing games, logging on to social media, and browsing
            content in general. That was the most telling aspect of this project, how difficult it is to �wean�
            ourselves off of our personal media devices, even with the facts right in our faces. In this sense, the
            lesson was that this topic is both important and applicable to the students that will be visiting our page.
            As we truly began to understand what attention and distraction can do to how we function as human beings, it
            became prevalent that everything that distracts/attracts us is deliberately done. The power lies with the
            companies and people who create this content, not with the audience. It is only when the audience becomes
            aware of what is going on around them, that they can truly begin to regain that power. It is essentially a
            sense of digital literacy; being able to communicate, decipher and download information in an environment
            where social and philosophical trends are changing by the second. As Yoram Eshet-Alkalai and Oren Soffer
            point out, Professors at The Open University of Israel, �digital technologies have penetrated almost every
            aspect of our lives.� It is for this reason that they argue, and so do we, that users need to master an
            array of social and cognitive competencies that allow us to function effectively online. It is our intention
            for this webpage to serve as one of the foundational resources for the course. It helps set the basis for
            understanding online behavior and why it has a hold on us. Something that this page will not provide is a
            step-by-step guide. What this page will provide rather, is a way of thinking and processing information, to
            where our audience will be able to reach a solution naturally. We hope our page serves as a lense in which
            to view human interactions in a digital space. Being that this is a course all about digital environments we
            feel that the cause, effect and solution to distraction are the perfect way to introduce the content the
            class will uncover.
