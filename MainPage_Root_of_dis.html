                            <p>First off, we have to bust the myth of multitasking. There is no such thing as
                                effectively working on two parallel activities. In fact, what we are doing is
                                task-switching quickly (PAGE RHEINGOLD). As good as you may think you are at
                                multitasking, it's been found that you are likely to be pretty bad at it. Three
                                different studies conducted by German researchers indicated that "media multitasking"
                                (engaging in one medium along with other media or non-media activities) correlates with
                                negative performance in school (Aagaard PAGE). Basically, we compromise performance for
                                distraction. Our attention is something that we can control to a degree but we are more
                                likely to let distractions impede on our focus. With all the external stimuli grabbing
                                our focus at any given moment, we sometimes lose that needed control. Why? Well Jasper
                                Aagaard, the lead German researcher attributes some of the digital distraction to the
                                fact that we are entirely hands on with the content that distracts us (PAGE). In a way,
                                our devices, the technology within them and the information that we engage with is a
                                reflection and extension of ourselves. That's why responding to a text, posting a
                                comment or liking an image seems so innate for us.
                            </p>

                            <p>Our inability to focus and desire to multitask has lead us to consume an average of 10
                                hours and 45 minutes worth of media content into 7 and 1/2 hours of media use (Carrier
                                et. al 2015). In a research paper produced by a group of esteemed physicians, findings
                                indicated that we continue to multitask because we believe that it helps rather than
                                hinders us (Carrier et. al 2015). This idea is supported by Rheingold throughout his
                                examination of attention.</p>

                            <p>So, there’s that - multitasking. But, we also have to consider the fact that we are
                                hardwired to pay attention to one another. Rheingold actually points to the fact that
                                humans are, at the core, social beings and we use “mirror neurons” (impulses that fire
                                when we are doing the same action as another human) to understand one another (40). So
                                now, with all the social avenues available online, we are feeding those very impulses
                                rapidly and willfully. We invite you to consider the reasons people feel so inclined to
                                participate in distracting activities such as Facebook scrolling or Tweeting. Indeed, it
                                has to do with the fact that we are watching other people do things we find interesting.
                                But additionally, one sociologist found that we are actively participating in shaping
                                the world around us. Dr. Shelly Boulianne found that the relationship between our use of
                                social media to participate is likely to be “causal and transformative” (Boulianne
                                2014). This means that there is a literal cause and effect correlation as to why we
                                spend our time on social sites.</p>

                        <div id="inner_8">
                            <p>An example is this: You feel lonely so you post a picture to Instagram for your wider
                                social circle to interact with you.

                            <p>Transformative in the way Boulianne examines it, means that we are enacting our ability
                                to cause change (2014). Though her examination is of direct participation in global
                                events, as she cites the Arab Spring and the 2012 Obama campaign, we find this to be
                                true in our microactions online as well. Mass jokes about the Kardashian sisters and the
                                popularity of Donald Trump are current examples of the ways we are changing the topics
                                of discussions we partake in daily. And probably more importantly, we are changing the
                                perspective society has of those topics.</p>

                            <p> In his book, Rheingold notes that humans are wired to recognize and pay attention to
                                visual patterns. He goes on to explain that making meaning from meshing language and
                                vision is a technology that has been facilitated through the existence of attention
                                (Rheingold 59) Being that most of the digital world is visually interactive, it’s
                                natural that we get distracted by the sight of a notification or a movie advertisement.
                                Basically, it’s not all your fault!

                                The stimuli we tend to face on a day to day basis is extraordinarily tangible. That it -
                                we are hands on engaging with what causes us distraction (PAGE). Think for a moment
                                about the

                                Aside from our inherent attention to visual cues, our desire to do more and our need to
                                engage with other people, there are several cited reasons for which we participate in
                                distractive activities. In their study, Carrier et. al. found that other causes such as
                                time constraints, boredom and because - simply put - they can (Carrier et. al 2015).
                                This means that, to a degree, we have allowed ourselves to become distracted through the
                                use our devices. But don’t worry, we have some solutions.

            First and foremost, there was a degree of meta thinking that went into creating this page. Particularly
            because
            the topic had to deal with attention and distraction. Despite being knee deep in the research behind why it
            happens and how to fix it, it was still prevalent in day to day life. In this sense, the lesson was that
            this
            topic is both important and applicable to the students that will be visiting our page. This page will serve
            as
            one of the foundational resources for the course. It helps set the basis for understanding online behavior
            and
            why it has a hold on us. Being that this is a course all about digital environments we feel that the cause,
            effect and solution to distraction are the perfect way to introduce the content the class will uncover.
